        <p>Hey guys, it's me, Trey Kline. I am a Computer Science student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and I am graduating this spring!
          I have a passion for innovation and using data to create new and exciting things. When I graduate I hope to find a job where I can pursue that passion.    
        </p>
        <p>Since January, I have been employed at Rose-Hulman Ventures, an engineering consulting company. I worked on two projects, one alone and one in a team of three. For the first project, I was tasked with creating a website to be used by community leaders to track local events. The second project involved me and my team creating an app to track equipment inspections along with an API to let this app communicate with a database. These projects greatly expanded my coding proficiency, as well as helped me develop the stick-to-itiveness and determination needed to solve tough problems on a daily basis. Our project manager took a very hands-off approach, allowing me and my teammates to take control and guide the projects. Not only did this teach me leadership, but it helped me learn how to properly manage my time and coordinate with teammates to work at maximum efficiency.</p>
